<p>Dear students,</p>

<p>We are writing to check in about your study partners. Although our hope is to form groups with the same composition for the entire semester, that's not always possible.</p>

<p>Another student has requested study partners for your class, and we have not been able to find a match for them. We'd like to ask that you please consider adding this fellow student to your group. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. If we don't hear back from you we'll connect you all via email.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
