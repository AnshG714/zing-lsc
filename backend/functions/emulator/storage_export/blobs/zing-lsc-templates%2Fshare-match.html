  You all shared interest in studying with other students. We are so glad you
  reached out!

  Whether you will be

    >studying together in-person or online</a
  >, LSC has tips for setting your group's agenda and making the most out of
  studying together. Consider working together at a time when you can use course

  or <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/tutoring/schedule/">LSC tutoring</a> to
  answer questions that may arise. Having study partners can be an important

<p>
  It is the responsibility of you and your study partners to understand and
  adhere to your instructor's expectations regarding group work. If you are not
  sure, ask! See

  Due to privacy rules we are not able to disclose which classes the student(s)
  receiving this email are taking, but you have been matched because you
  expressed interest in finding study partners for the same course. Although
  it's a little strange, your first group assignment will be to figure out what
  course you've been matched on.
