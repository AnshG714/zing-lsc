<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
  We are writing to check in. We hope your group has been able to meet and that
  you are finding it useful to study with others!
</p>

<p>
  We know that sometimes matched students are not able to find a time to meet
  that works for everyone, someone decides they don't want to do group work
  after all, someone drops the class, etc etc.

    >If this group has not been able to meet and you would like to be
    re-grouped:</b

  reply to this email to let us know what's going on. We can add you back to the
  active list of students looking for study partners and try again. (Please DO
  NOT fill out the webform again)
</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
