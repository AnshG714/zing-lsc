<div> Dear students,  </div>
<div>
 We are writing to you because you have expressed interest in studying with 
other students. We are so glad you reached out! Studying with peers is 
known to be an <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/studying-together/" > effective learning tool </a>, but whether you are learning online or
in-person it can be challenging, especially in large classes, to find study 
partners. 
<br> 
Study partners should take it from here and get in touch with each other 
about when and how to study together. You can just hit “reply all” to get 
connected with each other. Based on student feedback from last semester- 
this semester we are offering study partners the opportunity to meet with 
LSC peer study skills tutors to help facilitate introductions and get you 
launched. <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/enroll/PWR8F9"> Self-enroll </a> in the study skills tutors’ Canvas site to see when drop-
in hours are held, you can show up any time that works for your group. You 
can also drop in to see the study skills tutors if you have questions about 
getting started with your group.
<br>
Due to privacy rules we are not able to disclose which classes the student(s) 
receiving this email are taking, but you have been matched because you 
expressed interest in finding study partners for the same course. So, your 
first group assignment will be to figure it out!
<br> 
Whether you will be studying together <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/studying-together/studying-together-in-person/">in-person </a> 
or <a href= "http://lsc.cornell.edu/studying-together/studying-together-online/ "> online </a>, 
use the LSC’s tips 
for setting your group’s agenda and making the most out of studying 
together. Consider working together at a time when you can use course 
<a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/office-hours/" > office hours </a> or 
<a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/tutoring/schedule/"> LSC tutoring </a> to answer questions that may arise!
<br> 
If you’d like more info about studying together please contact LSC Study 
Partners lscstudypartners@cornell.edu We will be following up later in the 
semester to find out how it’s going.

<br> 
Happy studying!`
