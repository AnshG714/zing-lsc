<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We are writing to let you know we were unable to find study partners for the class(es) you requested-{{NAME OF
  CLASS}}--it just turned out that we did not get other requests. Please try again next semester! LSC makes a few
  thousand matches each year, we are very sorry that your request wasnâ€™t one of them. In the meantime, the [LSC
  website](http://lsc.cornell.edu/) offers lots of information about general study skills, learning effectively, and
  academic support.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>
