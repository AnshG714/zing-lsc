<p>Dear students,</p>

<p>We are writing to you because you have expressed interest in studying with other students. We are so glad you reached out! Studying with peers is known to be an effective learning tool, but whether you are learning online or in-person it can be challenging, especially in large classes, to find study partners.</p>

<p>{{NEW_STUDENT_NAME}}, within the past few days we tried to match you with another student who requested a study partner for the same class(es) you listed but haven’t had any luck. Fortunately, a small group that we matched recently is happy to have another student join them in studying. Thank you, {{OTHER_STUDENTS_NAMES}}!
(Due to privacy rules we are not able to disclose which classes the student(s) receiving this email are taking, but you have been matched because you expressed interest in finding study partners for the same course.)
</p>

<p>Whether you will be studying together in-person or online, use the LSC’s tips for setting your group’s agenda and making the most out of studying together. Consider working together at a time when you can use course office hours or LSC tutoring to answer questions that may arise!</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of you and your study partners to understand and adhere to your instructor's expectations regarding group work. If you are not sure, ask! See <a href = "https://provost.cornell.edu/leadership/vp-undergrad-ed/academic-integrity/"> Cornell's policy on academic integrity </a> for more info.</p>
<p>If you’d like more info about studying together please contact LSC Study Partners lscstudypartners@cornell.edu We will be following up later in the semester to find out how it’s going. </p>

<p>Happy studying!</p>
