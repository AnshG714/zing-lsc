Dear <data>, 

We are writing to follow up and let you know that unfortunately we have not been successful, so far, in finding study partners for the class(es) you requested. Weâ€™ll be in touch again if another student requests study partners for your class(es). In the meantime, the LSC website (http://lsc.cornell.edu/) offers lots of information about general study skills, learning effectively, and tutoring.
